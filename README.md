Winning board loses to (3, 8). The only safe move (5, 3) loses to (3, 5) as X is forced to play (5, 1),
but after (8, 5)! O wins. Solution: immediately giving free move (5, 1)! wins for X.

Two moves only: (3, 0) which gives opponent free move and (3, 6) which forces O to 6 and blocks O from winning board 3.
Yet after (3, 6) - (6, 3) - (3, 0) - (5, 4) we have draw. After (3, 0) - (5, 4) - (6, 8) wins, after (3, 0) - (6, 8) - (5, 4) wins.

Moves (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8) loses to (0, 1) - (3, 4) - (4, 3) as O wins one more board. Drawing line is (4, 6)! - (3, 4) - (4, 3) as X manages to hold board 0 while winning board 4.
