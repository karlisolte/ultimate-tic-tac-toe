Winning board loses to (3, 8). The only safe move (5, 3) loses to (3, 5) as X is forced to play (5, 1),
but after (8, 5)! O wins. Solution: immediately giving free move (5, 1)! wins for X.

X to play at board 4 and win:

Winning board loses to (5, 7)! followed by (0, 5).  

O played (6, 0) refusing to win board and giving free move instead. If O played (6, 1), (1, 4)! winds for X.
