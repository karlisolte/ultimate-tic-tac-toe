Winning board loses to (3, 8). The only safe move (5, 3) loses to (3, 5) as X is forced to play (5, 1),
but after (8, 5)! O wins. Solution: immediately giving free move (5, 1)! wins for X.

Winning board loses to (0, 1) as O wins also the last board. The only free move (4, 3) loses to (3, 4).
Moves (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8) loses to (0, 1) - (3, 4) - (4, 3) as O wins one more board. Drawing line is (4, 6)! - (3, 4) - (4, 3) as X manages to hold board 0 while winning board 4.
